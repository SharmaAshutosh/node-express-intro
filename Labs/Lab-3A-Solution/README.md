# Unit 3-A Lab

## Lab Overview

For this lab, you will be writing test cases for the utility functions and asynchronous functions you created back in the first and third lab. We are writing tests for these functions because our server doesn't have any logic to test besides CRUD operations to the database. 

For this lab, you should create one `describe()` block per utility function and add as many tests() as you think are necessary.

## Lab Starter Code

Your lab will start off with all of the code from the previous lab. In addition, your utility functions and asynchronous functions will be added in `src/util.js` and `src/starwars.js` and a test file will be provided in `tests/app.test.js`. Jest will be also be added as a dependency and your test script will be modified to use Jest. 

You can clone your starter code here:

**Note:** Make sure to swap the MongoDB database connecting string in `index.js` with your own cloud MongoDB instance's connection string.

Make sure to install all of the dependencies with:
```
$ npm install
```

You can run your tests with:

```
$ node run test
```
## Lab Solution

**Note:** Make sure to swap the MongoDB database connecting string in `index.js` with your own cloud MongoDB instance's connection string if you test out the solution.
