# Unit 1C Lab

## Lab Overview

This lab will be an exercise in making network requests to other APIs using Node.js. 

You will be implementing a couple of functions that make network requests to the Star Wars API. Those functions should return Promises containing data from the Star Wars API.

There will be test cases already set up to verify that your functions are returning Promises that contain the right data.


## Lab Source Code
You will be given a starter node.js project that has `jest`, `axios` and `node-fetch` installed. There will be some function definitions in `src/starwars.js` that you will need to fill out. Your test cases are located in `tests/app.test.js`

Here's a link to the Star Wars API documentation:
